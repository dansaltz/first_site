            <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
            <p>Jungfrau is a city in Switzerland known for its mountain summits nicknamed the “top of Europe.” It is very famous also for its railway created in 1912 that can bring you to a height of 3454m. At the summit there are outstanding views where you can see the whole city and beyond.</p>
            <p>The scenery consists of valleys, waterfalls, rock walls, and snow peaks. When visiting, it is vital to go on a day with good weather because it enhances the quality of the views. Hiking is very popular at short trails called Grutschalp and Murren. A very common tourist attraction is also exploring the Lauterbrunnen valley.</p>
