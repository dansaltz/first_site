7. 	Jungfrau is a city in Switzerland known for its mountain summits nicknamed the “top of Europe.” It is very famous also for its railway created in 1912 that can bring you to a height of 3454m. At the summit there are outstanding views where you can see the whole city and beyond. 
8. 	The scenery consists of valleys, waterfalls, rock walls, and snow peaks. When visiting, it is vital to go on a day with good weather because it enhances the quality of the views. Hiking is very popular at short trails called Grutschalp and Murren. A very common tourist attraction is also exploring the Lauterbrunnen valley.
